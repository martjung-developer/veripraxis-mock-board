    question: 'How do I start a mock board exam?',
    answer:
      'Go to Mock Exams in the sidebar. Find the exam for your degree program — if its status is Available, click Start Exam. An instructions screen appears before the timer begins. Ensure a stable internet connection and sufficient time before starting, as leaving mid-exam may count as a submission.',
  },
  {
    id: '2', category: 'taking',
    question: 'Can I pause or save my progress mid-exam?',
    answer:
      'No. Once you start, the countdown timer runs continuously — even if you close the browser. Exams simulate actual PRC board exam conditions and cannot be paused. If your connection drops, answers saved up to that point may be retained; contact support if you believe your session was cut short unfairly.',
  },
  {
    id: '3', category: 'taking',
    question: 'Can I go back and change answers before submitting?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Navigate freely between questions using the question navigator panel. Answered items are highlighted. Review all flagged or skipped items before clicking Submit Exam. Once submitted, answers are final.',
  },
  {
    id: '4', category: 'results',
    question: 'Where can I view my exam results and scores?',
    answer:
      'After submitting, your score appears immediately on the Results screen. Access all past results anytime via Results in the sidebar — each entry shows score, percentage, time taken, and a subject-area breakdown.',
  },
  {
    id: '5', category: 'results',
    question: 'Can I review which questions I got wrong after submitting?',
    answer:
      'Yes. On the Results page, click Review Answers next to any completed exam to see each question, your answer, the correct answer, and a brief rationale. Use this to identify weak areas and focus your reviewer sessions.',
  },
  {
    id: '6', category: 'reviewers',
    question: 'What is the difference between a Reviewer and a Mock Exam?',
    answer:
      'A Reviewer is untimed and practice-mode — you answer at your own pace with instant per-item feedback. A Mock Exam is timed and simulates actual board exam conditions to assess readiness under pressure.',
  },
  {
    id: '7', category: 'timing',
    question: 'What happens when the exam timer reaches zero?',
    answer:
      'The exam is automatically submitted with all answers marked up to that point. Unanswered items are scored as incorrect. You are taken directly to the Results screen — there is no grace period.',

    question: 'How do I reset my password?',

    id: '10', category: 'technical',
    question: 'The exam page is not loading or shows a blank screen. What should I do?',
    answer:
      'Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R / Cmd+Shift+R), clear your browser cache, and try again. Use Chrome 110+, Firefox 115+, or Edge. Disable extensions that may block scripts. If the issue persists, note any error message and contact support before starting another session.',
